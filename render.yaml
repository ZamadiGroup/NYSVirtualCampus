# Minimal Render spec: deploy the API as a Docker web service.
# After adding this file, connect your GitHub repo to Render and create a new service
# from the repo; Render will use this file to auto-create the service.

services:
  - type: web
    name: nys-virtual-campus-api
    env: docker
    plan: free
    dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
    instanceType: "free"
    autoDeploy: true

# Note: Do NOT include secrets here. Set the following environment variables in
# the Render dashboard for the service after creation:
#   MONGODB_URI  -> your MongoDB connection string
#   JWT_SECRET   -> secure JWT secret
#   PORT         -> optional (defaults to 5000)

# If you prefer a Render Static Site for the client (dist/public) instead of Vercel,
# you can create a separate static site in the Render dashboard with:
#   Build Command: npm ci && npm run build
#   Publish Directory: dist/public
# This repo's root `npm run build` produces the client at dist/public.
